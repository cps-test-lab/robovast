# RoboVAST

Variation Automation and Scalable Testing for Robotic Systems.

**RoboVAST** is an open-source framework for automated, large-scale integration testing of robotic software in simulated environments. Built upon proven foundations including the [Floorplan-DSL](https://secorolab.github.io/FloorPlan-DSL/) for parameterizable indoor environment generation, [scenario-execution](https://cps-test-lab.github.io/scenario-execution/) for single test execution, and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for orchestration, RoboVAST enables developers to systematically validate their systems across thousands of varied test scenarios.
