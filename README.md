# RoboVAST

Variation Automation and Scalable Testing for Robotic Systems.

**RoboVAST** is an open-source framework for automated, large-scale integration testing of robotic software in simulated environments. Built upon proven foundations including the Floorplan-DSL for parameterizable indoor environment generation, scenario-execution for single test execution, and Kubernetes for orchestration, RoboVAST enables developers to systematically validate their systems across thousands of varied test scenarios.
